# Formal Report OpenACP

Report current state, completed work, unverified claims, blockers, next actions, authority limits, and basis references.

Use owner-readable language. Do not call validator pass semantic approval or reviewer recommendation final acceptance.

Every formal report must carry a `Response ID`, not `Report ID`. It must also include a `Response log path:` line. If there is no persisted log file, write `Response log path: chat reply` or the project-local status artifact path.

Use the user's preferred language when it is known. If the language is not known, keep the language consistent with the user's current conversation.

When the preferred language is Chinese, use Chinese as the main language for headings, summaries, table cells, evidence explanations, and next actions. Keep English only for stable technical terms and exact names such as `Primary`, `Frontier`, `worker`, `reviewer`, `handoff`, `validator`, `source pack`, `Prompt ID`, `Response ID`, `CARD`, `task-card`, `B0/B1/B2/B3`, `CI`, `CLI`, `JSON`, `schema`, exact file names, or project-specific product terms. Do not write long English sentences or paragraphs in a Chinese report.

## Chat Table Fit Rule

Formal reports are often rendered in narrow chat panes. Keep the table readable:

- Use short first-column labels. Generic reports may use `Changed`, `Progress`, `Gate`, `Area`, `Goal`, `Gaps`, `Next`.
- Chinese post-install and generic startup reports should use `做了什么`, `总体进度`, `验证`, `范围`, `目标`, `缺口`, `下一步`.
- Primary Chinese reports should use `做了什么`, `总体进度`, `Frontier`, `目标`, `缺口`, `下一步`.
- Frontier Chinese reports should use `做了什么`, `总体进度`, `Lane`, `目标`, `缺口`, `下一步`.
- Keep each table cell to a short summary.
- Do not use free-form row labels such as `安装`, `Skill`, `CLI`, `项目`, `状态`, `What changed`, `Lane or area`, `Next step`, `Validation`, or `Checkpoint`.
- Do not put long paths, URLs, commit hashes, full commands, validation logs, executable paths, local install paths, or long inline-code snippets inside table cells.
- Do not include PowerShell blocks, bash blocks, shell command blocks, command lists, or command dumps anywhere in a chat formal report. Validation evidence should be a short status only, such as `验证通过` or `Validation passed`.
- Put only short evidence notes after the table. Chinese reports use `依据与验证`; English reports use `Evidence and Validation`.
- Always use the exact table header `| 报告项 | 内容 |` for Chinese reports or `| Item | Content |` for English reports. Legacy short Chinese headers, mixed status headers, field/content headers, and custom headers are invalid.
- Do not pad first-column labels with ideographic spaces. The wider `报告项` / `Item` header keeps the left column readable in Codex chat.
- Keep validation, gate, or checkpoint-like information in the `验证` / `Gate` row for generic reports or in the evidence section outside the table. The table row set excludes `Checkpoint`.

## Post-Install Startup Report

After installing OpenACP as a skill + workflow kit, produce a formal report automatically as part of startup.

The startup formal report should state:

- what was installed or loaded,
- whether validation passed or failed,
- whether the OpenACP skills are available,
- whether `openacp` and `openacp-validate` are available,
- current startup state,
- gaps,
- next step.

The startup report must not show validation commands, shell snippets, PowerShell snippets, local executable paths, skill install paths, or temporary install directories. The `验证` or `Gate` row should only say whether validation passed or failed. If details are needed, use one short sentence outside the table, not a command block.

The next step must ask for:

- your working directory, which is required,
- your current source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path,
- your preferred language for future Primary, Frontier, worker, reviewer, and discovery replies.

If no prepared facts path exists, ask the user to upload or attach the project materials. Uploaded materials become candidate facts; the working directory is still required.

End the post-install report with human-readable wording, not a vague checklist. The meaning should be:

```text
I have installed and validated OpenACP, but I cannot build a useful Primary launcher yet because I do not know where your project work should happen, which materials count as current facts, or which language future agents should use. Please send me one clear working directory. This is required. Also send your source pack, PRD, spec, design document, or facts path. If you do not have a clean facts path yet, you can upload the project materials instead and I will treat them as candidate facts, but I still need the working directory. Please also tell me your preferred language; if you omit it, I will keep using your current language.
```

## Next Step Rule

The next step in a formal report must be actionable.

For Primary, name the decision, dispatch, consume, or closure action Primary should perform.

For Frontier, include a Frontier-owned B0/B1/B2 action when any safe lane-local work remains. Return to Primary only when the report includes closure proof showing every visible remaining gap is final-authority-only or explicitly out.

Avoid a next step that only says "wait". If waiting is unavoidable, name what evidence or user fact is missing and what prepared packet will be used when it arrives.

## Required Human Ending

Every formal report must end with a short human-readable section named `Recommended Next Step` for English or `下一步建议` for Chinese.

This section is outside the table. It should say the practical current situation and the next action in plain language:

- If the user needs to do something, name the exact path, fact, approval, or left-sidebar thread action.
- If no user action is needed, say that no human action is needed and name the next Primary-owned or Frontier-owned action.
- Do not end with validation details, command output, file lists, or links alone.
