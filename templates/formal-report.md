## Role-Aware Rows

Use these rows for a Chinese Primary report:

| 类型和状态 | 内容 |
|---|---|
| 做了什么 | |
| 总体进度 | Include a numeric estimate. |
| Frontier | |
| 目标 | |

## Evidence and Validation

- Notes:

## Recommended Next Step

Explain what the human should do now. If no human action is needed, say that plainly and name the next Primary-owned or Frontier-owned action.

Do not claim final states without final-authority evidence.

Keep the table cells short. Put long paths, URLs, commit hashes, validation output, and evidence lists in `Evidence and Validation` instead of the table.

Do not include shell command blocks, PowerShell blocks, bash blocks, command dumps, executable paths, or local install paths in a chat formal report. For validation, write only a short status such as `验证通过` or `Validation passed`.

For Chinese reports, name the evidence section `依据与验证` and the final section `下一步建议`. For English reports, use `Evidence and Validation` and `Recommended Next Step`.

For Chinese chat reports, use the pure Markdown header `类型和状态`. Do not use `<nobr>`, HTML wrappers, invisible characters, or spacing tricks.

## Post-Install Startup Note

When this report is used immediately after installing OpenACCP, keep the `Next` cell short, for example: `Ask for the three project setup inputs.` Put the actual numbered input request in the final `Recommended Next Step` / `下一步建议` section. The final section asks for facts input, working directory, and repo path; explains that the working directory is the local agent coordination workbench; explains that the `repo path` is the actual product code repository path; and says preferred language is optional. Do not end with only "send paths"; explain what will happen after the user provides the inputs.

## Mini Example

| Item/Status | Content |
|---|---|
| Changed | A worker handoff and reviewer report are ready for final consume. |
| Progress | 70%. The work is implemented and reviewed, but final authority has not accepted it. |
| Gate | Reviewed evidence exists; final consume is pending. |
| Area | Handoff review. |
| Goal | Decide whether the reviewed evidence can be accepted. |
| Gaps | The final consume decision and release checks are still pending. |
| Next | Primary or the human owner should inspect the reviewed evidence and decide accept, amend, or reject. |
