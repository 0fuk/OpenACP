# Short Chat Launcher

Use this template for the copyable chat launcher shown to the user after the full prompt record has been written to disk.

Do not include the full prompt body in chat. The short launcher only points the new thread to the local prompt record.

The short launcher must be written to disk and printed in chat as a fenced `prompt` block. A saved `.short.md` file is required for audit, but a file link, attachment, file list, or `Get-Content` command is not a substitute for the copyable chat block.

```prompt
<Project> - <Role/Slot> - <Short Task>
Purpose: <one short sentence>

Read and execute this OpenACCP prompt record:
- Prompt Record: <absolute-or-user-visible-path>
- Prompt ID: <prompt-id>
- Preferred language: <preferred-language-or-current-conversation-language>

Hard requirements:
1. Read the prompt record explicitly as UTF-8.
2. Execute only the named Prompt ID.
3. If the file cannot be read cleanly, the Prompt ID is missing, or the text appears corrupted, stop and report launcher-read failure.
```
