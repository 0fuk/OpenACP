# OpenACP

OpenACP, short for Open Agent Coordination Protocol, is an open workflow kit for coordinating multiple AI agents across planning, implementation, review, and delivery. It is not an agent runtime, model framework, IDE plugin, or prompt collection. It gives teams a reusable way to decide who can act, what counts as evidence, how work is handed off, and when a result is only provisional.

## Who This Is For

OpenACP is for teams that want agents to work in parallel without losing control of scope, facts, review, or final authority. It is especially useful when a project has more than one worker, multiple branches or worktrees, reviewer sidecars, changing source material, or a human owner who needs readable status instead of raw logs.

It also helps teams that only have a rough PRD or product idea. In that case, ACP Bootstrap turns the idea into a minimal source pack, scope boundary, assumptions ledger, starter spec, and first task card before implementation begins.

OpenACP is not for replacing tests, CI, code review, security review, legal review, release ownership, or engineering judgment. The validator checks structure and common unsafe claims; it does not decide whether the product is correct or whether a change should merge.

## Start With Codex Or Claude Code

Ask Codex/Claude Code:

```text
Install https://github.com/0fuk/OpenACP as a skill + workflow kit, then follow the README startup flow.
```

The agent should install the OpenACP skills and Python workflow kit, run validation, and then produce a formal report automatically. The formal report is part of the startup flow; the user should not need to ask for it separately.

After installation and validation, there will be a formal report. In the next step, I will ask you for:

- your working directory
- your current source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path

After you provide those, I will return one Primary Orchestrator launcher and two Frontier Orchestrator launchers for this project.

Expected agent startup flow:

1. Clone `https://github.com/0fuk/OpenACP`.
2. Install or load every skill under `skills/`.
3. Install the Python workflow kit with `python -m pip install -e .`.
4. Run validation:
   - `python tools/openacp_validate_selftest.py`
   - `python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact . --ruleset public-package --strict`
   - `openacp --version`
   - `openacp-validate --version`
5. Read the installed skills plus the shortest docs path.
6. Produce a formal report using `templates/formal-report.md`.
7. Ask for the user's real working directory and source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path.
8. After the user provides those paths, return one Primary Orchestrator launcher and two Frontier Orchestrator launchers.

Skills to install or load:

- `skills/primary-orchestrator-openacp/`
- `skills/frontier-orchestrator-openacp/`
- `skills/worker-openacp/`
- `skills/reviewer-openacp/`
- `skills/formal-report-openacp/`
- `skills/human-explain-openacp/`
- `skills/handoff-consume-openacp/`
- `skills/source-pack-openacp/`
- `skills/bootstrap-openacp/`
- `skills/discovery-openacp/`
- `skills/validator-openacp/`

Do not create a demo package by default. Use `openacp init` only when the user has no current source pack, PRD package, spec, or facts path and explicitly wants bootstrap artifacts.

Read the detailed startup contract in `docs/codex-install-and-start.md`.

## Developer Validation

Prerequisite: Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0fuk/OpenACP.git
cd OpenACP
python tools/openacp_validate_selftest.py
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact . --ruleset public-package --strict
```

Validate the complete single-worker fixture:

```bash
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/source-pack.json --ruleset source-pack --strict
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/authority-charter.json --ruleset authority-charter --strict
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/task-card.json --ruleset task-card --source-pack examples/single-worker-flow/source-pack.json --strict
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/handoff.json --ruleset handoff --task-card examples/single-worker-flow/task-card.json --strict
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/review-report.json --ruleset review-report --strict
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact examples/single-worker-flow/status-report.json --ruleset status-report --strict
```

Install local CLI entry points during development:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
openacp --help
openacp --version
openacp-validate --help
openacp-validate --version
```

If you do not have a source pack, PRD package, spec, or facts path, create a starter package from a vague PRD or product note:

```bash
openacp init ./my-openacp-package
openacp init ./my-openacp-package --write
```

`openacp init` is a dry run by default. It is a bootstrap fallback, not the default startup path. Use `--write` only when the target directory is correct.

## Core Flow

```text
rough idea or PRD
  -> source pack
  -> scope boundary + assumptions
  -> task card + authority charter
  -> worker in a bounded workspace
  -> handoff with verification evidence
  -> reviewer report
  -> final consume by Primary or human owner
```

Read the shortest path first:

1. `docs/codex-install-and-start.md`
2. `docs/getting-started.md`
3. `docs/role-model.md`
4. `docs/authority-boundary.md`
5. `docs/validator.md`
6. `examples/primary-two-frontier-kickoff/README.md`
7. `examples/single-worker-flow/README.md`

Do not read every template before starting. Use the source pack and task card to decide what context is actually needed.

## Two Layers

### ACP Bootstrap

Use ACP Bootstrap when a project has only a rough product idea, lightweight PRD, or scattered notes. Bootstrap creates the first working package: PRD intake, current source pack, scope boundary, assumptions ledger, open questions, starter spec, and initial task cards.

The pain it solves is premature execution. A worker should not guess a spec, invent authority, or treat brainstorming as current truth.

### ACP Coordination

Use ACP Coordination when the project already has enough local facts to dispatch agents. Coordination defines Primary, Frontier, worker, reviewer, authority boundaries, task cards, independent worktrees or branches, handoffs, sidecar reviews, validator gates, formal reports, and human-readable status.

The pain it solves is coordination drift. In multi-agent work, the hard problem is often not writing code; it is keeping facts current, scope bounded, claims reviewable, and final authority separate from provisional evidence.

## Role And Authority Model

- `Primary`: owns final consume, merge or release decisions, and final authority.
- `Frontier`: orchestrates a lane, prepares packages, and may dispatch scoped work when explicitly chartered.
- `worker`: executes a bounded task card and produces a handoff.
- `reviewer`: checks scope, evidence, and claims without becoming final authority.
- `human owner`: decides product intent, risk tolerance, and release acceptance when required.

Authority levels:

- `B0`: read-only discovery and review.
- `B1`: packaging, task-card drafting, verification matrix preparation.
- `B2`: scoped execution under a task card and authority charter.
- `B3`: final authority such as accept, waive, merge, release, or publish.

## Templates And Validation

Markdown templates are authoring aids. JSON artifacts are the machine-checkable form used by the validator.

Task-card strict validation should include the source pack:

```bash
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact task-card.json --ruleset task-card --source-pack source-pack.json --strict
```

Handoff strict validation should include the task card:

```bash
python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact handoff.json --ruleset handoff --task-card task-card.json --strict
```

For B2/B3 task cards, strict validation requires `authorityCharterRef`. This keeps execution authority and final authority visible instead of implicit.

## Examples

- `examples/single-worker-flow/`: complete strict-validation fixture.
- `examples/prd-only-bootstrap/`: strict bootstrap fixture for teams starting from a rough PRD.
- `examples/primary-two-frontier-kickoff/`: startup example for one Primary and two Frontier launchers.
- `examples/primary-orchestrator-flow/`: concept example for final-authority dispatch and consume.
- `examples/frontier-lane-flow/`: concept example for lane authority.
- `examples/multi-worktree-review/`: concept example for multiple workers and reviewer sidecars.

Only the first two are intended as ready-to-run validation fixtures. The concept examples show shape and vocabulary, not a complete artifact bundle.

## Repository Map

```text
docs/        Concepts, role model, authority model, bootstrap, coordination, validator rules.
templates/   Reusable Markdown templates for PRD intake, source packs, specs, prompts, reports.
schemas/     Minimal JSON Schemas for machine-checkable coordination artifacts.
tools/       Validator and helper CLI.
skills/      Portable agent skills for using OpenACP workflows.
examples/    Strict fixtures and concept examples.
```

Internal reports, local logs, private source packs, and release working notes belong in ignored local paths such as `.openacp-local/`, not in the public package.

## Positioning

OpenACP can be used with Claude Workflow, SuperClaude, Aider, OpenHands, SWE-agent, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, the OpenAI Agents SDK, Codex, or a custom agent stack. Those projects help agents run, reason, code, or orchestrate. OpenACP focuses on reusable coordination artifacts: source packs, authority boundaries, task cards, handoffs, review reports, validator gates, and final consume decisions.

## Minimum Useful Setup

The smallest useful OpenACP setup is one source pack, one scope boundary, one task card, one authority charter for executable work, one worker handoff, one reviewer report, and one final consume decision by the authorized owner.
