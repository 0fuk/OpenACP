# Primary Plus Two Frontier Kickoff

This example shows the expected post-install startup output shape after a user provides a real working directory and a source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path.

It is not a demo package. It is a launcher pattern for starting real work.

## Required User Inputs

The agent should ask for:

- working directory,
- current source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path.

Optional but useful:

- writable paths,
- read-only reference paths,
- forbidden paths or side effects,
- known lanes or priorities.

## Output Shape

After the user provides paths, return:

1. One Primary Orchestrator launcher.
2. Two Frontier Orchestrator launchers.

Use:

- `templates/primary-orchestrator-launcher.md`
- `templates/frontier-orchestrator-launcher.md`

## Example Primary Launcher Summary

```text
Role: Primary Orchestrator
Authority: B3 final authority
Working directory: <user-provided path>
Facts path: <user-provided source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path>
Goal: decide source status, authority boundaries, and lane split.
Next action: read the facts path, issue a startup formal report, then dispatch two bounded Frontier lanes.
```

## Example Frontier A Launcher Summary

```text
Role: Frontier Orchestrator
Authority: B0/B1 by default, B2 only if explicitly chartered
Lane: <lane A objective>
Working directory: <user-provided path>
Facts path: <user-provided source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path>
Goal: discover gaps, prepare task cards, and identify safe worker packages for lane A.
```

## Example Frontier B Launcher Summary

```text
Role: Frontier Orchestrator
Authority: B0/B1 by default, B2 only if explicitly chartered
Lane: <lane B objective>
Working directory: <user-provided path>
Facts path: <user-provided source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path>
Goal: discover gaps, prepare task cards, and identify safe worker packages for lane B.
```

If the facts path is not enough to define two lanes, the Primary launcher should say so and ask for the missing decision instead of inventing lanes.
