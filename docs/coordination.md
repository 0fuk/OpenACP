# ACP Coordination

ACP Coordination manages multi-agent work once a project has enough local facts.

## Flow

1. Confirm source pack.
2. Assign authority boundaries.
3. Create task cards.
4. Dispatch scoped workers or reviewers.
5. Collect handoffs.
6. Validate artifacts.
7. Run sidecar review.
8. Consume evidence through final authority.
9. Report status in human-readable form.

## Active Closure

OpenACP coordination is an active closure loop, not a passive status chain.

Primary and Frontier should repeatedly:

1. refresh facts,
2. classify gaps,
3. dispatch bounded subagents when useful,
4. consume handoffs and reviews,
5. update backlog,
6. continue B0/B1/B2-safe work,
7. reserve only true final-authority decisions for B3.

A lane is not closed because a seed checklist is complete. A lane closes only when the current visible gaps are resolved, child dispatches have returned, failed, or been cancelled, present child handoffs are consumed or rejected by the parent orchestrator, remaining gaps are explicitly out, or the only remaining work is final-authority-only with a Primary-ready packet.

## Coordination Control Plane

OpenACP uses a small `.openacp/coordination/` control plane so separate threads can share facts without relying on chat memory.

Core artifacts:

- `runtime-boundary.json`: repo path, base branch, source roots, test entrypoints, worktree policy, writable/read-only/forbidden paths, side effects, data risk, and `b2DispatchGate`.
- `current-manifest.json`: current source pack, source status registry, runtime boundary, lane registry, CARD registry, active lanes, and latest consume refs.
- `sequence-registry.json`: Prompt IDs, Response IDs, handoffs, consumes, cards, active lanes, lifecycle states, and current/latest pointers.
- `lane-registry.json`: Primary and Frontier lane objectives, project complexity, Frontier dispatch mode, lane-count reason, assigned CARDs, authority, child ledger refs, closure refs, return-gate state, and per-lane `b2DispatchGate`.
- `child-ledgers/<lane-id>.json`: child worker/reviewer/discovery/validation lifecycle status and consume status for one lane.
- `source-status-registry.json`: current, reference, deprecated, invalid, and unknown source status with reasons.
- `decision-registry.json`: owner questions, Primary decisions, waivers, out-of-scope decisions, blockers, and safe defaults.
- `frontier-closures/<lane-id>.json`: proof that a Frontier lane can continue, close, or return to Primary.

Primary should establish the runtime boundary before B2 Frontier dispatch. If product repo path, base branch, source roots, test entrypoints, or worktree policy are missing, Primary should ask the user and continue safe B0/B1 packaging instead of making each Frontier rediscover the same blocker. A Frontier can still run coordination-only or read-only B2 work, but product-write B2 dispatch requires both runtime `b2DispatchGate` and lane `b2DispatchGate` to be ready for product-write work.

## Subagents

Use subagents for bounded work:

- discovery,
- reviewer sidecars,
- task-card preparation,
- scoped workers,
- validation or risk scan.

Each subagent needs a role, authority boundary, input facts, allowed scope, forbidden scope, stop conditions, and expected output. The parent orchestrator must consume the result before claiming progress.

Primary should create or refresh CARDs before Frontier dispatch. A Primary-launched Frontier should usually receive B2 lane-local authority so it can actively run B0 discovery, B1 packaging, B2 scoped worker or reviewer dispatch, child handoff consume, and closure proof inside the assigned lane.

Frontier should not ask the human to open worker, reviewer, discovery, validation, or task-card-only child threads when direct subagent or delegation tools are available and the work is B0/B1/B2-safe. Full child prompt records may still be written to disk for audit and reproducibility, but the Frontier should dispatch and consume that child work itself. Short child launchers are fallback artifacts only; when used, they must state why direct dispatch was unavailable or unsafe and what the human must do next.

## Parallel Work

Parallel work is safer when scopes are disjoint, handoff paths do not collide, reviewers know their targets, and final authority owns integration order.

Parallel work is risky when multiple agents edit the same contract, schema, dependency lock, migration, or runtime policy without a shared plan.
