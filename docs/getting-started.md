# Getting Started

OpenACCP has two adoption paths. Pick the shortest one that matches your current material.

For Codex or Claude Code startup, begin with `docs/codex-install-and-start.md`. The default path is to install skills, install the workflow kit, validate, produce a formal report automatically, then ask for the required working directory, a source pack, PRD, spec, facts path or uploaded project materials, and the user's preferred language. After those inputs arrive, startup returns one short Primary launcher only, printed in chat as a fenced `prompt` block; Primary later reviews the workspace, creates CARDs, and decides whether to launch Frontier lanes.

For normal or medium-complexity projects, Primary should usually create enough CARDs to support useful parallelism and then launch at least two Frontier lanes when two safe independent CARD clusters exist. One Frontier is only for a clearly small project, a single safe lane, or an explicit user request, and Primary must state that reason. Medium-high projects usually need two to five Frontiers; more than five requires explicit user approval.

## Path A: I Only Have A PRD

Use ACCP Bootstrap when the project starts from a rough PRD, product note, or vague design.

1. Fill `templates/prd-intake.md`.
2. Create `source-pack.json` from the current note or PRD.
3. Create `scope-boundary.json` to name what is in, out, deferred, and approval-gated.
4. Record assumptions in `assumptions.json`.
5. Draft starter specs from `templates/spec-starter/`.
6. Create the first `task-card.json`.
7. Add `authority-charter.json` if the task requires B2 execution.
8. Validate the task card with the source pack.

The Bootstrap path prevents agents from inventing a spec or treating old brainstorming as current truth.

## Path B: I Already Have A Work Package

Use ACCP Coordination when the project already has enough facts to dispatch agents.

1. Confirm the current source pack.
2. Define roles and authority boundaries.
3. Split backlog into lanes and task cards.
4. Dispatch scoped workers in separate workspaces or branches.
5. Require structured handoffs.
6. Run sidecar review.
7. Let Primary or the human owner consume reviewed evidence.

## Minimum Safe Flow

```text
source pack -> scope boundary -> task card -> authority charter -> worker -> handoff -> reviewer -> final consume
```

If a step is missing, use discovery or bootstrap before implementation.
