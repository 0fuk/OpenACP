# Codex And Claude Code Install Startup

This is the default OpenACP startup path for an agent that can install skills or load workflow instructions.

## User Prompt

Ask Codex/Claude Code:

```text
Install https://github.com/0fuk/OpenACP as a skill + workflow kit, then follow the README startup flow.
```

## Agent Startup Contract

The agent should:

1. Clone or open `https://github.com/0fuk/OpenACP`.
2. Install or load all OpenACP skills from `skills/`.
3. Install the Python workflow kit with `python -m pip install -e .`.
4. Run validation:
   - `python tools/openacp_validate_selftest.py`
   - `python tools/openacp_validate.py --artifact . --ruleset public-package --strict`
   - `openacp --version`
   - `openacp-validate --version`
5. Read:
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/getting-started.md`
   - `docs/role-model.md`
   - `docs/authority-boundary.md`
   - `docs/validator.md`
   - `skills/primary-orchestrator-openacp/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/frontier-orchestrator-openacp/SKILL.md`
   - `skills/formal-report-openacp/SKILL.md`
   - `templates/primary-orchestrator-launcher.md`
   - `templates/frontier-orchestrator-launcher.md`
6. Produce a formal report automatically after installation and validation.
7. Ask the user for the real project inputs.

## Skills To Install Or Load

- `skills/primary-orchestrator-openacp/`
- `skills/frontier-orchestrator-openacp/`
- `skills/worker-openacp/`
- `skills/reviewer-openacp/`
- `skills/formal-report-openacp/`
- `skills/human-explain-openacp/`
- `skills/handoff-consume-openacp/`
- `skills/source-pack-openacp/`
- `skills/bootstrap-openacp/`
- `skills/discovery-openacp/`
- `skills/validator-openacp/`

## Automatic Formal Report

The formal report is not a separate user command. It is the required post-install output.

The report should include:

- what was installed or loaded,
- which validation commands passed or failed,
- whether OpenACP skills are available,
- whether the CLI is available,
- current startup state,
- gaps,
- next step.

The next step must ask for:

- your working directory,
- your current source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path.

## After The User Provides Paths

After the user provides a working directory and facts path, the agent should return:

- one Primary Orchestrator launcher,
- two Frontier Orchestrator launchers.

Use:

- `templates/primary-orchestrator-launcher.md`
- `templates/frontier-orchestrator-launcher.md`
- `examples/primary-two-frontier-kickoff/`

The launchers must name:

- role,
- authority level,
- working directory,
- source pack or facts path,
- writable paths,
- read-only references,
- forbidden paths or side effects,
- validation expectations,
- handoff or report expectations.

If the user has no source pack, PRD, spec, or facts path, do not invent one. Offer the bootstrap path and use `openacp init` only after the user explicitly approves creating starter artifacts.

## Skill Install Notes

For Codex, install the directories under `skills/` as local skills if skill installation is available. If native skill installation is unavailable, load the relevant `SKILL.md` files as workflow instructions for the current session.

For Claude Code or another coding agent, treat `skills/*/SKILL.md` as the workflow instructions to load before starting orchestration.
